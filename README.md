# day-52_auto_insta_follower
Day 52 of 100.

Auto Insta-follower. It's probably a good idea to follow people with common interests. Like if you're really into cooking, you can find others who are interested in that as well quite easily by going to a major cooking page, and following the people that follow the page. That's the concept behind this project. Not necessarily to get more followers but to increase my own immersion in the field.

The thing about testing code, it can be tricky especially when creating bots because obviously, you don't want anyone to notice something like that. So, I delayed certain actions with 'time.sleep()' and passed a random amount of seconds. Ranging from 4-14. Scrolling was very tricky as it is outside of my comfort zone especially since it was a pop-up. Used 'try/except/finally' in case of Exceptions, and of course, the while loop was the hero of the day.
